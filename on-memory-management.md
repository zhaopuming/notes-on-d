But you can get a _long_ way just by being smart about your GC use. A number of D programmers have managed to use D with full use of the GC in high performance code simply by doing stuff like make sure that a collection cycle doesn't kick in in hot spots in the program (e.g. by calling GC.disable when entering the hot spot and then GC.enable when leaving), and for programs that need to do real-time stuff that can't afford to have a particular thread be stopped by a GC collection, you just use a thread that's not managed by the GC for that critical thread, and it's able to keep going even if the rest of the program is temporarily stopped by a collection.
